# Media Checker

The objective of this program is to provide users with a simple method of obtaining relevant information on their favorite movies and television shows.  First, the user must enter the title of a movie or show into the input area, and then click the "Submit" button.  This activates a JavaScript function that uses Ajax to make an API call to the website omdb.com ("Online Movie Database").  The program asks omdb for the relevant information on the film or show that the user has inquired about.  If there is a relevant match, omdb then automatically sends back to the program the requested information, which is then displayed on the browser.  Information displayed includes a plot summary of the film, the names of the director and actors, and an image of the official poster.
